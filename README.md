# space_the_last_place_to_work

Space, it's the last place to work. Can you make a living? 
Maybe. 
More likely you'll burn out your remaining energy in the quest for riches and die drifting alone encouraging your crew not to eat each other (for decencies sake) in some uncharted part of space.

A Gleam project themed on the 80s BBS space resource text based adventure games. 

100% no guarantee this will be near as fun as those.
